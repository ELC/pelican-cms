# Pelican CMS

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pelican-cms/badge/?version=latest&style=for-the-badge)](https://pelican-cms.readthedocs.io/)

Pelican-CMS achieves a friendly web interface so that users without programming knowledge can create and maintain a blog built with Pelican (static website generator) and based on Git.

## Motivation

There are lots of CMS out there with user friendly interfaces for non-technical users (Such as Wordpress, Drupal and so on), personally I use Pelican since it's built with Python. But I couldn't find any extension or plugin that provide a UI layer to convert Pelican in a more user friendly Static Site Generator.

There are other options like Lektor but this project attempts to provide a similar interface so that non-technical users could migrate to Pelican.

## Why a Static Site Generator?

There are loads of articles and posts discussing how static sites (Jekyll, Pelican, Lektor) compare with dynamic ones (Wordpress, Drupal, Blogger). I won't cover this here or point to some resource since it could get outdated really quick. Just make your research and if Static Sites are suitable for you and you want to use Pelican, this project might be helpful.
